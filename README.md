# Manya Kanojia

I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at GITM - Gurugram University. I have a strong interest in solving real-world problems through technology and am actively involved in various co-curricular activities, including hackathons and inter-college technical competitions. My academic and practical experiences have allowed me to build a solid foundation across multiple domains in tech.

My technical skill set includes proficiency in machine learning frameworks such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow, as well as data handling libraries like Pandas and NumPy. On the development side, I work with modern frontend technologies including React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am equally comfortable on the backend, where I use Node.js and Express.js to build REST APIs. For databases, I work with MongoDB and am currently learning PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM to strengthen my full-stack capabilities.

I also have a conceptual understanding of IoT technologies, including Arduino, sensors, and MQTT. My programming experience spans Python, JavaScript, and C++, and I use tools like Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code for version control and development. Currently, I am exploring advanced technologies such as Docker, AWS, tRPC, Nx/Turborepo, and microservices architecture to broaden my knowledge in scalable systems design.

My primary goal is to build scalable, AI-driven applications that can solve practical problems and have real-world impact. I aim to contribute meaningfully to open-source and collaborative projects while continuously learning and evolving with the latest trends in technology.
